# End-to-End Tests with Protractor and Angular

This is a simple Pastebin Application built using Angular. This application serves as an introduction to testing using Protractor

## How to get started?

Clone the repo and switch to the starter branch. Alternatively, select starter branch and download the zip. The final branch has the final version of the tests. 

## Running the Application
Once you are on the starter branch, head to a terminal and run `npm install`.

Now run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running Protractor Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the tests on Chrome. For more configurations, see protractor.conf.js
